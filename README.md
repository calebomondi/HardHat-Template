# HARDHAT TEMPLATE

- This template was created to the shorten the hardhat setup and configuration time.
- All you need is to clone it then run the necessary commands to install the necessary modules

- Commands to run after cloning:

  ```shell
  npm install
  npx i dotenv
  ```
- The template comes with a simple counter smart contract that you can interact with
  1. Compile the contract
  ``` shell
  npx hardhat compile
  ```
  2. Test the contract
  ```shell
  npx hardhat test
  ```
- Deployment
  1. Deploying locally
  ```shell
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
  ```
  2. Deploying to sepolia testnet
  ```shell
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network sepolia
  ```

- In hardhat.config.ts you can change the network URL to infura if you are not using Alchemy
- Add the .env file to the project root folder then add the ALCHEMY_RPC_SEPOLIA URL and your WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY

- This is the deploy.ts TEMPLATE
  ```solidity
  // scripts/deploy.ts
  import { ethers } from "hardhat";
  
  async function main() {
    // Get the contract factory
    const ContractName = await ethers.getContractFactory("YourContractName");
    
    // Deploy the contract
    const contract = await ContractName.deploy();
    
    // Wait for the contract to be deployed
    await contract.deploymentTransaction()?.wait();
    
    console.log(`Contract deployed to: ${await contract.getAddress()}`);
  }
  
  // Recommended pattern for handling async errors
  main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
      process.exit(1);
    });
  ```
